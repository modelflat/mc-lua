    Returns the total amount of fuel + waste which can be contained in the reactor at one time, in milli-buckets (mB)
getControlRodName		    Integer: control rod index		    String
    Returns the user-set name for the specified control rod, as a string. String is empty if the name is not set
getControlRodLevel		    Integer: control rod index		    Integer
    Returns an integer indicating how far the specified control rod is inserted into the reactor,
    range is from 0 (not inserted) to 100 (fully inserted)
getEnergyProducedLastTick	None		                        Float
    Returns an estimate of the Redstone Flux (RF) energy generated in the past tick.
    If the reactor is actively cooled, returns the amount of hot fluid produced in the past tick, in milli-Buckets (mB).
getHotFluidProducedLastTick	None		                        Float
    Returns the amount of hot fluid produced in the past tick, in milli-Buckets (mB).
    If the reactor is passively cooled, always returns 0.
getCoolantType		        None		                        String or Nil
    Returns the Fluid Dictionary name of the type of fluid contained in the multi-block reactor's coolant tank,
    or Nil if the tank is empty.
getCoolantAmount		    None		                        Integer
    Returns the amount of coolant fluid contained in the multi-block reactor's coolant tank, in milli-buckets (mB)
getHotFluidType		        None		                        String or Nil
    Returns the Fluid Dictionary name of the type of fluid contained in the multi-block reactor's hot-fluid tank,
    or Nil if the tank is empty.
getHotFluidAmount		    None		                        Integer
    Returns the amount of superheated fluid contained in the multi-block reactor's hot-fluid tank, in milli-buckets (mB)
getFuelReactivity		    None		                        Integer
    Returns the reactivity level of the reactor's fuel. 100 = 100 percent
getFuelConsumedLastTick		None		                        Float
    Returns the amount of fuel consumed last tick, in milli-buckets (mB).
    Note that fractional milliBuckets can be consumed, so this can return, for example, 0.5
isActivelyCooled		    None		                        Boolean
    Returns true if the multi-block reactor is in "active cooling" mode, false otherwise
setActive		            Boolean: active?		            None
    Sets the reactor to be active if the argument is true, or inactive if the argument is false
setAllControlRodLevels		Integer: insertion level (0-100)	None
    Sets all control rods to the specified insertion level. Range is from 0 (not inserted) to 100 (fully inserted)
setControlRodLevel		    Integer: control rod index,
                            Integer: insertion level (0-100)	None
    Sets the specified control rod (first argument) to the specified insertion level (second argument). Insertion level range is from 0 to 100, as above.
doEjectWaste		        None		                        None
    Instruct the reactor to attempt to eject any waste in the reactor via its access ports. The reactor will favor access ports set to Out. 1 ingot of waste will be ejected per 1000 mB currently in the reactor. If there is less than 1000 mB of waste in the reactor, nothing will happen.
